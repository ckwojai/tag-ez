* Getting started
1) Activate your Python virtual environment (preferably Conda with Python 3.7+) in your terminal
2) run ~pip install -r requirements.txt~ to install dependencies
3) run ~jupyter notebook~
4) Within the notebook in your browser, open examine_dataset.ipynb or Model Training.ipynb and run all cells
* Objectives
- We want to improve experience for users when they ask questioin in Q&A platform, such as Stack Overflow, Quora, etc., by automatically suggesting tags based on the question they are asking.
- In essence, we would like to develop a Machine Learning model that can predict related tags, given questions title and text
* Dataset
- We will be using a subset of data scraped from StackOverflow (Tile and Body -> Tags), with over 6M datapoints
# * Approach
# - We are going to train our model using Binary Relevance Method with One vs Rest Classifier; and compare their performance
